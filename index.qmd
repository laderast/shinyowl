# Learning Objectives

This workshop aims to get you over the hill to faster, better looking, and dynamic Shiny Apps.

1. **Customize** dashboards with `{bslib}` and `{thematic}`
1. **Explain** fundamentals of Reactive Programming
1. **Utilize** Shiny modules in your projects

In other words, we're learning how to Draw the Owl:

## Expectations

I've tried to make this easier to understand. However, there are some Shiny concepts that are just inherently difficult to understand. So be easy on yourself (and me).

Be gentle with yourself and others if there is confusion. We'll work through it.
