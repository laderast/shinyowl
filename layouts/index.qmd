## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Modify the `value_box` code in `layouts/app_bslib_box_layout.R`. Try out the following:

- Different colors: check out [R-Gallery's Color Picker](https://r-graph-gallery.com/color-palette-finder)
- Different icons: check out [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- Different content

If you like, paste it into the Cascadia-R slack channel.

### Exercise 2

```
